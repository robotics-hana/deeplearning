The model achieves higher precision and recall for the PNEUMONIA class than for the NORMAL class, with a notable proportion of NORMAL images being misclassified as PNEUMONIA. This behaviour is expected given the strong class imbalance in the dataset and the use of standard cross-entropy loss without any imbalance correction.\n",

        "The training and validation curves indicate stable convergence without severe overfitting, although validation accuracy is occasionally higher than training accuracy due to data augmentation and regularisation applied during training. Overall, while the baseline model provides strong initial performance, its sensitivity to class imbalance and limited architectural capacity suggest several avenues for improvement. In particular, explicitly addressing class imbalance, strengthening the feature extractor, and refining the training strategy are likely to improve both balanced performance and overall robustness."
